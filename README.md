 ## 🔫 Shootings & Firearm Discharges: Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository!
This project explores firearm-related incidents in Toronto using publicly available data provided by the Toronto Police Service.  
The goal is to build a data warehouse that supports analytics on public safety trends, injury outcomes, and potential implications for emergency and trauma services.

### 🎯 Project Objectives
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

### 🔧 Project Specifications

- **Data Source**: Import publicly available CSV data from the Toronto Open Data Portal, specifically the “Shootings & Firearm Discharges” dataset maintained by the Toronto Police Service.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and transform the data to handle null values, duplicate rows, inconsistent time formats, and standardized naming for neighbourhoods and divisions.
- **Integration**: Develop a unified data model that includes shooting incidents, geographical neighbourhoods, time dimensions (year, month, day, hour), and injury severity levels.
- **Scope**: Focus on the most recent data (post-2014, after the records system change) for improved consistency and data completeness.
- **Documentation**: Provide entity-relationship (ER) diagrams and clear table descriptions to support both public health analysts and data engineering professionals.
